# Correlation between Covid19 and Mobility
The project deals with presenting a data visualization regarding the effects of the *CoVid-19 Pandemic* in Italy, during the year 2020. This work focuses the attention towards an hypothetical governmental decision maker, who needs to evaluate the effectiveness of the current anti-contagion measures to plan out the future actions. For accomplishing this task, through a visual environment, a comparison in certain temporal intervals between the variation of people’s movement and some indicators of the pandemic situation is performed, with respect to the different Italian Regions.
